Dear parents,

As part of a long-term research project, we, the Center for Artificial Intelligence at Nuremberg Institute of Technology, are monitoring the linguistic development of preschool children. The aim is to develop a computer system that can provide automatic and reliable support in analyzing children's language development. In our research project, we are investigating whether and, if so, how automatic language processing methods can be used to achieve early detection of language development disorders. To do this, we need to teach the computer how children speak. To achieve this, we need a lot of high-quality speech data from children.

This is why we are contacting you. With your consent, we would like to record your child speaking. The recordings will take place during the usual language tests as part of the school entry examination. You have already been informed of your child's kindergarten appointment by the public health department. This data enables us to research how we can model children's speech in computer systems and whether this modeling allows us to draw conclusions about speech development.

The recorded data is stored digitally on a computer.  It is ensured that only members of the research team who have been explicitly sworn to data protection and confidentiality have access to the data.

We very much hope that you will agree to the recording, as good speech recordings are essential for our research. By doing so, you will be supporting research into automatic systems that can detect language development in children at an early stage and thus provide targeted support to improve language skills in the future. Please complete the enclosed declaration of consent after reading the privacy policy linked below or accessible via QR code. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. Participation is voluntary and a subsequent objection to the declaration of consent and the use of the questionnaire is of course possible.

Best Regards

Prof. Dr. Tobias Bocklet

## Privacy policy
As part of this research project, audio recordings of the language tests during the school entry examination are recorded and processed. The files of the audio recordings are named with an abbreviation so that it is not possible to associate the recording directly with the name of your child. In addition, personal data (i.e. age, gender, information about the parents' native language) is also recorded and processed pseudonymously. This data is processed on the basis of Article 6(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which enables lawful processing if you give your voluntary and informed consent to the processing of this personal data. Since your child's language development data is also collected as part of the research project, this processing is carried out in accordance with Article 9(2)(a) GDPR, which permits the processing of this data if you expressly consent to the processing of this data.

In the interests of transparency, we would therefore like to provide you with comprehensive information about the type of data processing and your rights. All data collected from your child as part of this research project will be treated as strictly confidential and secured against unauthorized access. Data about you and your children will be collected by the Nuremberg Institute of Technology as part of the research project in the context of the school entry examination and stored in accordance with the legal requirements, but only using a pseudonym/code. Neither name nor initials or date of birth appear in the encryption code. At no time during the study is the identity of the participant visible from the data record.

Access to the original data and the encryption key is restricted to the study director (Prof. Dr. Tobias Bocklet, Nuremberg Institute of Technology, Faculty of Computer Science / KIZ) and the employees entrusted with the input, statistical evaluation and processing of the data (research assistants, doctoral students, students working on their theses). Your original data is protected against unauthorized access and the mapping file is stored in encrypted form on another drive.

The processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with Art. 4 BayDSG in conjunction with Art. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR, Art. 85 GDPR, Art. 25 BayDSG and Recital 33 GDPR, according to which it is possible for data subjects to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research if this is done in compliance with the ethical standards of scientific research. Ethical procedures for scientific research at German institutions require that individuals explicitly agree to be part of recorded research and how the information contained in their approach will be used. All personal data collected is pseudonymized. Pseudonymization means that personal data is processed in such a way that it can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of the key file. The results of the research project are presented in summarized form in relation to groups. Publications do not allow any conclusions to be drawn about individual participants. No information is published or included that could identify you personally.

In order to protect your children's data, we will already apply the strictest requirements stipulated by the EU AI Regulation for high-risk AI systems to the data in view of the EU AI Regulation, which will come into force in 2026. The data will only be recorded if you consent to this and will then only be used for the research purpose stated here.

The data collected will be analyzed in several studies, which is why long-term storage of the data is necessary. The language data collected will be stored locally and securely for 10 years as part of the planned research. We ensure that all data is always processed within the university's internal infrastructure. Should it be necessary to involve external partners for specialized tasks, such as data annotation, this is done exclusively in strict compliance with data protection regulations and within clearly defined contractual agreements.

The voice recordings are used in the first study to find out whether it is generally possible to support the school entry examination with the help of automatic language processing methods. Statistical evaluations are also carried out in relation to personal data such as age, gender and the parents' mother tongue. In the further course, the extent to which dialectal differences have an influence on the systems examined will be analyzed. In this part of the study, personal data, in particular the mother tongue, is used. In the subsequent study, different methods of automatic language processing are evaluated with the help of the voice recordings in order to achieve the greatest possible support. The subsequent study is dedicated to the question of whether the methods found allow conclusions to be drawn about detailed aspects of language development based on the speech recordings. Finally, the speech recordings are used to analyze the explainability of the models/methods found in the previous studies. The results of the respective studies are published in the form of study results, whereby conclusions about individuals are excluded by pseudonymizing the data.  Original voice recordings are not published at any time.

After completion of the study, your data will be stored in accordance with legal requirements. After the archiving periods have expired, your data will be deleted and existing documents destroyed.

Participation in the study and your consent to the processing of your personal data is completely voluntary. If you do not wish to participate in the study or do not consent to data processing in the context of the study, you will not suffer any disadvantages as a result. You have the right to withdraw your consent to data processing at any time without giving reasons. This will also not result in any disadvantages for you. A legitimate request can only be approved if the data has not already been deleted or anonymized.

In the context of data processing, under the GDPR you have the right of access under Article 15 GDPR, the right to rectification under Article 16 GDPR, the right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR, the right to restriction of processing under Article 18 GDPR, the right to object under Article 21 GDPR. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority in accordance with Article 77 GDPR. As part of your right to object, you have the option to object at any time to specific decisions or measures relating to the processing of personal data concerning you. The personal data will then no longer be processed.

As part of your right to information, you have the option of receiving a copy of the personal data collected from you free of charge. In principle, you also have the right to have the data corrected or deleted if necessary. 

Your personal data will not be processed for the purpose of automated decision-making (including profiling) in accordance with Art. 22 (1) and (4) GDPR.
