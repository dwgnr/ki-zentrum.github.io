    Can artificial intelligence collaborate with humans in creative 
    processes at the same level? What would this collaboration look like? 
    These complex questions form the basis for the research conducted by 
    academics at Nuremberg Tech and Nuremberg University of Music as part 
    of an interdisciplinary project funded by LEONARDO - Center for 
    Creativity and Innovation.
